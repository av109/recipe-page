### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to effectively use CSS to style a responsive recipe page. Some key takeaways include:

- **Flexbox Layout**: I used flexbox to center the content horizontally and vertically, ensuring a consistent layout across different screen sizes.
- **Media Queries**: I implemented media queries to adjust the layout and styling for larger screens, ensuring the design remains responsive and visually appealing.
- **CSS Variables**: I utilized CSS variables for consistent theming and easier maintenance of color schemes throughout the stylesheet.
- **Box Sizing and Padding**: I learned the importance of using `box-sizing: border-box` to include padding and border in the element's total width and height, preventing overflow issues.
- **Image Styling**: I adjusted the image width and added padding to ensure the image fits within the container and has appropriate spacing around it.
- **Typography**: I applied custom fonts and adjusted font sizes and weights to enhance the readability and visual hierarchy of the text content.

Overall, this project helped me improve my CSS skills and understand the nuances of creating a responsive and visually appealing web page.
